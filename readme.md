## Tower Defense Game

The tower defense game is an interactive game in which players create towers to fight of the antagonists. At every arbitrary time unit, the antagonists move one step closer to fight the towers. Players earn money by having their towers attack and kill the antagonists.

### To do:

- Make sure the antagonist step forth at every time frame.
- Create a gif of the game.
- Create a spawning system.
- Create a player participation system. Players should be able to participate once they've commanded to build a tower.
